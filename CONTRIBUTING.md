# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, consider first discussing the change you
wish to make via issue, email, in person, or any other method with the owners of
this repository. That said, sometimes a Pull Request is the most effective way
to communicate an idea and it's fine to lead with a Pull Request so long as
you're open to discussion from there.

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions
with the project.

**All of the technical guidance here is on a try-your-best basis.**
All anyone can ask is that you try your best. Definitely do not let code
formatting or organizing your commits just so or questions about Semantic
Versioning or anything else be a barrier to contributing. Maintainers can help
you work through all of that and more in collaborating on your contribution,
and if need be can post-process contributions to smooth out rough edges.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any build or configuration artifacts are removed before submission
2. Increase the version number to the new version that this Pull Request would
  represent. This product uses [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
3. Update the README.md with relevant details of the change.
  variables, exposed ports, etc.
4. Open a pull request from your fork to the upstream master branch.
  Communicate that the Pull Request is a work-in-progress if it is not yet ready
  to merge and use in production settings, by using
  [GitHub's draft Pull Requests feature][] or prepending "WIP: " to the Pull
  Request title.
5. Squash commits to the smallest meaningful number of revisions.
  Do not include merge commits.
6. Fully test the change—collaborating with maintainers as necessary—before
  merging the pull request.
7. You may merge the Pull Request in once you feel comfortable with it and have
  the sign-off of at least one other developer, or if you do not have permission
  to do that, you may request the reviewer to merge it for you.

* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or

when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of

further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

reported by contacting the project team by [email][email]. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an
